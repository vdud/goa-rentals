<!-- Points -->
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Flexibility:</strong> Bikes and scooties provide greater flexibility in exploring coastal
		areas compared to other modes of transportation. They are nimble and can navigate through narrow
		roads, allowing you to easily reach scenic spots, hidden beaches, and local attractions that might
		be inaccessible to larger vehicles.
	</li>

		<strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Renting a bike or scooty is generally more cost-effective than hiring
		a car or relying on public transportation. It can be a budget-friendly option, especially for solo
		travelers or small groups. Additionally, they consume less fuel, which can help save on expenses.

		<strong>Enjoyment of the scenery:</strong> Riding a bike or scooty allows you to fully immerse yourself

		crashing waves, and take in the breathtaking coastal views as you ride along the shoreline.

		<strong>Parking convenience:</strong> Finding parking spaces for bikes or scooties is usually easier

		<strong>Local exploration:</strong> Bikes and scooties enable you to explore coastal areas at a leisurely
		pace, giving you the opportunity to discover hidden gems, small coastal villages, and local eateries.
