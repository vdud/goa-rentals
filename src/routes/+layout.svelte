		<h2>Why Bike/Scooty Rentals?</h2>
		<p>
			There are several reasons why choosing a bike or scooty rental for travel in a coastal area
			can be advantageous:
		</p>
		<!-- Points -->
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Flexibility:</strong> Bikes and scooties provide greater flexibility in exploring coastal
				areas compared to other modes of transportation. They are nimble and can navigate through narrow
				roads, allowing you to easily reach scenic spots, hidden beaches, and local attractions that
				might be inaccessible to larger vehicles.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Renting a bike or scooty is generally more cost-effective than
				hiring a car or relying on public transportation. It can be a budget-friendly option, especially
				for solo travelers or small groups. Additionally, they consume less fuel, which can help save
				on expenses.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enjoyment of the scenery:</strong> Riding a bike or scooty allows you to fully immerse
				yourself in the coastal environment and enjoy the scenic beauty. You can feel the cool breeze,
				listen to the crashing waves, and take in the breathtaking coastal views as you ride along the
				shoreline.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Parking convenience:</strong> Finding parking spaces for bikes or scooties is usually
				easier compared to larger vehicles. Coastal areas can be crowded, especially during peak tourist
				seasons, and having a smaller mode of transport gives you an advantage in finding parking spots
				near popular attractions or beachfront areas.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Local exploration:</strong> Bikes and scooties enable you to explore coastal areas at
				a leisurely pace, giving you the opportunity to discover hidden gems, small coastal villages,
				and local eateries. You can easily stop whenever something catches your eye, allowing for a more
				immersive and personalized travel experience.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Environmental friendliness:</strong> Choosing a bike or scooty rental contributes to
				reducing your carbon footprint. They produce fewer emissions compared to cars, making them a
				more environmentally friendly mode of transportation. It's a way to enjoy the coastal beauty
				while being mindful of the environment.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Health and well-being:</strong> Riding a bike or scooty is a physically active mode of
				transportation that can benefit your health and well-being. Coastal areas often have pleasant
				weather and scenic routes, providing an enjoyable opportunity for exercise and outdoor activities.
			</li>
